# Distance-Based Alarm System with Arduino and Buzzer

This project demonstrates a simple alarm system using an ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04) and a buzzer connected to an Arduino. The buzzer sounds an alert if an object is detected within a specified distance range.

## Components Used

- Arduino (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
- Buzzer (included in the Forbot kits or similar)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Important Notes

- The buzzer is selected to work directly with Arduino without a current-limiting resistor.  
  If you're using a different buzzer, **check its current consumption** to avoid damaging your Arduino.
